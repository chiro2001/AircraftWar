/**
 * Sample library that can be called via luaj's require() implementation.
 * <p>
 * This library, when loaded, creates a lua package called "hyperbolic"
 * which has two functions, "sinh()" and "cosh()".
 * <p>
 * Because the class is in the default Java package, it can be called using
 * lua code such as:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * require 'hyperbolic'
 * print('sinh',  hyperbolic.sinh)
 * print('sinh(1.0)',  hyperbolic.sinh(1.0))
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * When require() loads the code, two things happen: 1) the public constructor
 * is called to construct a library instance, and 2) the instance is invoked
 * as a java call with no arguments.  This invocation should be used to initialize
 * the library, and add any values to globals that are desired.
